            <p> This is my Korean name that defines my constant
                focus in life. In short, <b>Kwang</b> means light and brilliance 
                signifying clarity in one's actions and intentions. <b>Hyo</b> 
                means respect, especially towards the elders. </p>

            <p> 
                Photography is a hobby close to my heart. It all started 
                with picking up a Nikon DSLR when I finally had enough time and
                money. Since then, I started a portrait photography business 
                that thrives on personal connection and emotion.
