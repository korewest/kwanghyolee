                This webpage was built from scratch for the purposes of 
                personal growth in web-development skills and also to leave a small footprint
                    about me on the internet. <br>
                    I have several features in mind to add to the webpage in the future such as 
                    a blog, embedded email form, and mobile enhancements. There's still some work to 
                    accomplish for multiple browser compatibilities. Meanwhile, please view with Chrome 
                    for best results.

                <p> <i>An avid alumni and advocate for University of the Pacific.</i> <br><br>
                From its small family of students and 
                    faculty to its amazing programs that offer industry experience, Pacific is a place that 
                    I will advocate for the rest of my life. I served as Pacific Ambassador introducing 
                    new students and families, and led orientation groups. As a growing professional in the 
                    tech industry, I represented <a href="http://www.onlab.us" target="_blank">ON.Lab</a> 
                    for recruitment of Pacific's engineer students and I continue to reach out in ways that I 
                    hope will help the engineering department. </p>

                <h1> Growing Up </h1>
                <p> My roots lie in South Korea where I was born and raised. When I was in 3rd grade, 
                my small family of 3 moved out to Chicago, IL. I will never forget the cold breeze that first 
                    greeted us, and perhaps it foreshadowed the hardships that we were about to face 
                    and endure. That didn't stop us from exploring the new country, however. We loved
                    roadtrips and drove to various states all around East Coast listening to casette tapes of 
                    The Eagles, Billy Joel, Beegees, and the likes. Our adventures eventually led us 
                    to Los Angeles, CA and it has been our home to this day.

            <p>
                I am currently having a blast applying to various jobs in the Bay area, as well as 
                Southern California / Seattle. I look forward to starting a career in software development and testing. 
                With the vast amount of free time that I have lately, I like to 
                spend it with close friends, work on side projects like this webpage, cook dishes that are not 
                always edible, and dream about the possibilities of opening a coffee house in downtown San Francisco.
